****

Heath comes from a line of entrepreneurial minded people. His father and mother both successfully pursued entrepreneurial endeavors in cattle ranching, real estate, property development and home construction. Heath acquired an education in graphic design and illustration and started his own business in Jackson Hole shortly after finishing college.

****

After selling his first business, and following in his families footsteps, Heath and his wife Lisa acquired property, strapped on their tool belts and built their house in Jackson Hole. Soon after the construction completed, Heath purchased and operated a marketing and sales business for the next four years. After successfully selling his second business and looking for another opportunity, he and his father Steve decided to partner and form the Wyoming Select Properties real estate team. Utilizing their extensive knowledge of the area and deep connections to the Valley, they are now providing real estate sales and acquisition services in Teton and Sublette counties.

****

Heath looks forward to horseback riding on the family ranch, mountain biking, rock climbing and skiing with his wife Lisa and their young twin boys. In his spare time, Heath enjoys programming in the Python programming language and playing with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
